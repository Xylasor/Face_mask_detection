Face mask detection with neural network
The goal of the project is to create the face mask detection system. Based on the photograph, it will be able to determine whether a given person is wearing a face mask or not. For that it was decided to create and train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In order to compare results I used pre-trained ResNet18 network and applied transfer learning.
